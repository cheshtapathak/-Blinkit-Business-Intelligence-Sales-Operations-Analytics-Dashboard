4. Data Source

Source: Blinkit Store Sales Dataset (CSV / Excel format)
Dataset Overview:

📄 Rows: ~8,523
📊 Columns: 12

Key Data Fields Used:

Item Fat Content (Low Fat, Regular)
Item Type (Fruits, Snacks, Frozen Foods, etc.)
Outlet Establishment Year
Outlet Location Type (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities)
Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High)
Outlet Type
Sales (Revenue per item/order)
Customer Rating

The dataset represents transactional-level sales data across multiple Blinkit outlets and product categories.

5. Features / Highlights
🔹 Business Problem

Blinkit operates across diverse city tiers, outlet sizes, and product categories. However, without consolidated analytics, it is difficult for stakeholders to quickly answer questions such as:

Which outlets and product categories generate the highest revenue?
Do outlet size and location significantly impact sales?
How do customer ratings correlate with sales performance?
Which product attributes contribute to higher customer satisfaction?
Raw data alone makes it challenging to uncover trends, inefficiencies, and growth opportunities.

🔹 Goal of the Dashboard

The primary objective of this project is to build a centralized analytics solution that:

Provides a high-level snapshot of Blinkit’s overall business health using KPIs
Enables deep-dive analysis into product, outlet, and customer dimensions
Supports management in identifying performance gaps and optimization opportunities
Demonstrates end-to-end data analytics skills using multiple industry tools

🔹 Key KPIs (High-Level Performance)

💰 Total Sales – Overall revenue generated
📦 Number of Items Sold – Total transactions/items
📊 Average Sales per Order – Revenue efficiency metric
⭐ Average Customer Rating – Customer satisfaction indicator

🔹 Walkthrough of Key Visuals & Analysis

🔹 Key Learning Emphasis

A major highlight of this project is the data cleaning and preparation phase, which accounted for approximately 70–75% of the total effort. Special attention was given to:

Standardizing categorical values (e.g., Item Fat Content inconsistencies)
Ensuring data quality before visualization
Building reliable KPIs across tools

This reflects real-world analytics workflows where clean data is the foundation of accurate insights.
